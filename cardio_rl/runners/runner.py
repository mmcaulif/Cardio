        Initialise the Runner. Contains the agent, gatherer, optional
        buffer and a logger, which are the necessary components for
        both collecting transitions with the gatherer and formatting
        them correctly for later use by the agent. Data is provided to
        the runner and from the runner to the agent as a dictionary
        with the following keys: s, a, r, s_p and d, as well as any
        extra specifications from the agent. The runner calls the
        gatherer's step function as part its own step function, or as
        part of its built in warmup (for collecting a large amount of
        initial data with your agent) and burnin (for randomly stepping
        through an environment, not collecting data, such as for
        initialising normalisation values) methods. The runner can
        either be used via its run method (which iteratively calls the
        runner.step and the agent.update methods) or with each mothod
        individually with its step method if you'd like more
        finegrained control.

            rollout_len (int, optional): Number of environment steps to
                perform as part of the step method. Defaults to 1.
            warmup_len (int, optional): Number of steps to perform with
                the agent before regular rollouts begin. Defaults to
                10_000.
            eval_env (gym.Env | None, optional): An optional separate
                environment to be used for evaluation, must not be a
                VectorEnv. Defaults to None.
            burnin_len (int, optional): Number of untracked environment
                steps to take before warmup, such as to initialise
                normalisation. Defaults to 0.
            extra_specs (dict | None, optional):  Additional entries to
                add to the replay buffer. Values must correspond to the
                shape. Defaults to None. Defaults to None.
            buffer (BaseBuffer | None, optional): Can pass a buffer
                which stores data and is randomly sampled when calling
                runner.step, if set to None a default TreeBuffer will
                be used with kwargs equal to those defined in the
                buffer_kwargs argument. Defaults to None.
            logger (BaseLogger | None, optional): The logger used
                during evaluations. If set to None, uses the BaseLogger
                which prints to terminal and writes to a file in a
                logs directory. Defaults to None.
